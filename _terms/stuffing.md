Stuffing is the process of placing cargo into a container to be moved. The more colloquial term might be "loading" but this collides with the "loading" of full containers onto an ocean vessel at port. So load/unload refers to containers being added/removed from vessels, while stuff/unstuff refers to cargo being added/removed from individual containers.
