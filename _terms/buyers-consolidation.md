Buyer's consolidation is a strategy for minimizing cost and transit time for small shipments originating from the same area headed for a single destination.

The canonical example here is with an ocean container. Multiple child LCL shipments from different factories are combined into a single FCL container at an origin CFS. This container then moves like a normal single-container FCL shipment all the way to final destination. This saves cost (because FCL is cheaper by volume/weight than LCL) as well as time (because destination deconsolidation is skipped).

In the canonical example, the logical consolidation matches the physical consolidation. Each LCL shipment has its own HBL at origin (issued by the forwarder), and the master container shipment has its own HBL (issued by the forwarder) and MBL (issued by the ocean carrier).

Another factor is custom clearance. A single customs declaration for the full container may be faster than multiple declarations.

There are several permutations:

- Buyer's consolidation may be purely logical. Multiple smaller child LCL shipments with their own HBLs may be combined into a single larger logical LCL shipment and tendered to a coloader such as Shipco for further consolidation. 
- Buyer's consolidation may be done with air freight, and possibly with trucking/rail, though I have only see it done with air and ocean.
- Buyer's consolidation may involve many-to-many origin-to-destination mapping. A large consignee with many destination warehouses across the USA and many origin factories across China may have portions of LCL shipments from various factories divvied up across multiple FCL containers, each destined for separate destination warehouses.
