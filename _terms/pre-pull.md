A pre-pull is when a container is picked up from port and temporarily stored at a trucker's container yard prior to final delivery. This may be done to help avoid demurrage fees at the port or to ensure that the trucker can meet an early or tight delivery window at the final destination (without the uncertainty of port wait time).
