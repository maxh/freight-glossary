Wikipedia says drayage is the movement of cargo over short distances. In my experience, it refers specifically to trucks hauling ISO 6436 intermodal containers to and from ocean or rail container yards.

For example, an ocean container moving from China to the USA would involve two drayage segments: drayage from factory to origin port, an ocean sailing from origin port to destination port, and drayage from destination port to the final destination warehouse.

(Note: I intentially use the term "segment" instead of "leg" here because drayage may actually involve two separate legs: a pre-pull leg from the port to a container yard followed by a final delivery leg.)

Drayage may also refer to the movement of empty containers, as in empty returns.
