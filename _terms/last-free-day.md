When an ocean vessel arrives at port, containers are unloaded from the vessel and stored in a container yard. There is a grace period after the containers are unloaded where the terminal will store the containers at no marginal cost while awaiting the arrival of trucking carriers to pickup the containers. After a certain point, this grace period ends and the terminal will start charging money, called [demurrage](/terms/demurrage). The "last free day" is the last day before this charge begins.
